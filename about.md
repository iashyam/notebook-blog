I am currenty working as an associate engineer at [McDermott International](https://www.mcdermott.com/Who-We-Are). My interests by the day are Physics, Programming, and Problem solving, as well as Philosophy, Poetry, and Literature by the night. 

Some evenings, I take a walk around the campus without my phone and try to observe things around me and within me. When I get back to my room, I write about my observations, and sometimes, I post them on this website. It includes articles about small and deep topics about daily life, poems and stories about the characters that live an independent life inside my head. 

My primary hobby is reading books, but I also write, dance (Bhangra), try to learn music, try to understand art, walk, run, watch, play and talk about cricket, clean my room, think and journal and many other things.

I read mystery, thrillers, philosophical and historical fiction, some light non-fiction.

I hail from a small village in northern Rajasthan near the Punjab and Haryana borders. I have done my Masters in Physics from IIT Madras and BSc in Physics from St. Stephen's College, New Delhi. I am currently staying in Chennai.
